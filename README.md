# 📌 Phishing Attack Simulation & Detection (Task 11)

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this task is to understand how phishing attacks work and how they can be detected and prevented through a simulation environment.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **GoPhish** – Phishing simulation tool  
- **Web Browser**  
- **Localhost Environment (127.0.0.1)**  

---

## 🔍 Task Overview
A phishing simulation was designed using GoPhish to demonstrate how attackers use fake emails and login pages to trick users into revealing sensitive information. The simulation focused on the setup and analysis process rather than real-world exploitation.

---

## ✉ Email Template
A phishing email was created that mimics a security alert to generate urgency and encourage users to click a malicious link.

**Subject Used:**  
`Urgent: Verify Your Account`

**Phishing Indicators in Email:**
- Urgent language  
- Request for account verification  
- Suspicious embedded link  

---

## 🌐 Landing Page
A fake login page was developed to simulate credential harvesting.

**Landing Page Features:**
- Username field  
- Password field  
- Data capture enabled  

---

## 👥 Target Users
A test user group was created to simulate potential phishing victims. Only authorized/test accounts were used.

---

## 🚀 Campaign Execution

A phishing campaign was configured using:
- Created Email Template  
- Fake Landing Page  
- Test User Group  

### ⚠ Technical Limitation
The campaign could not be fully executed due to **SMTP/email server configuration issues** in the local environment. As a result, email delivery could not be completed. However, the full phishing setup process, tracking mechanism, and simulation workflow were successfully demonstrated.

---

## 📊 Expected Results (Simulation)
GoPhish normally tracks:
- Emails opened  
- Links clicked  
- Credentials submitted  

The dashboard and campaign configuration screenshots are included to demonstrate how tracking works.

---

## 🚩 Phishing Red Flags Identified
- Suspicious sender address  
- Urgent tone in email  
- Request for credentials  
- Fake login interface  

---

## 🛡 Prevention Methods
- Verify sender email address  
- Avoid clicking unknown links  
- Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
- Security awareness training  
- Email spam filtering systems  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Although the phishing campaign could not be fully delivered due to technical limitations, the task successfully demonstrated how phishing attacks are structured and how detection and prevention measures can reduce risk. The simulation provided valuable insight into social engineering techniques and cybersecurity defense strategies.
